GuardUniform 1.73 Documentation

1. Guards will always be wearing chain armor with a certain enchantment
depending on their rank. This chain armor cannot be taken off, and will not drop on death.

The enchantments of the armor are configurable in config.yml.
The armor permission nodes are as follows:

uniform.alphaguard
uniform.guard
uniform.trainee

2. When a player with any of the above permission nodes joins the game, the plugin will check
if the player has the armor specified in config.yml.

If the player does not have the armor, then the plugin will try to auto-equip the new armor
and put the player's currently worn armor into his/her inventory.

If the player's inventory is full, the player will be sent a message telling them to free up
inventory space and relog to receive their uniform.

3. Players with the permission nodes specified above will also drop a full set of iron armor.
The durability of each of the armor pieces are calculated like so:

50% chance of the armor being 50% - 100% damaged
50% chance of the armor being 0 - 50% damaged

4. Players with the permission nodes specified above cannot drop health potions from their inventory
or drop them on death.

- This applies to both regular instant health (drinkable type) and splash instant health.

They will not be able to drop the potion whether it be by:
- Using the drop button key
- Removing it through the use of the inventory interface

5. If ever non-guards receive chain armor, they will not be able to equip it.
